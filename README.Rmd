of mrgsolve.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrgsolve/knobs")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(knobs)
## basic example code

mrgsolve::house() %>% 
  knobs(CL = c(0.5,1,2), VC = c(10,20), amt = 100) %>%
  plot(CP ~ time|CL*VC,scales="same")
```
